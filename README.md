# Top 12 Software Engineering Books

If you are midway through your career books will help you grow fast and climb up the ladder. Here's a list I am sharing from one of the software books I have read by Jon Sonmez. A short description is added to give you succinct insight before getting started with the actual reading. Happy Learning!

## Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition

This is a foundational and pivotal book on writing good, clean, understandable code that clearly communicates what the code does without the need for excessive comments. It talks about how to debug code, create quality software, and many other topics every software developer should understand. The book is a little dated as far as methodologies go, but is still a must-read book for every serious software developer.

## Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship

This book teaches you how to write clean, highly understandable code and to refactor existing code by example. It is full of principles and best practices that are timeless in nature and greatly aid the understanding of code written in any programming language. While Code Complete is a bit dated in terms of methodology, Clean Code makes up for it by presenting an Agile way of crafting and maintaining software.

## Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices

Another book by Uncle Bob, but this one focuses more on object-oriented programming. It covers a wide range of topics from Agile methodology and how to use it, to object oriented design principles, to design patterns and more—all with excellent examples.

## Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

This book is a classic, but it’s still relevant today, as you’ll commonly see design patterns in code you are maintaining, or you’ll recognize some of these patterns in code you are writing. Every software developer should at least understand the basic, classic design patterns presented in this book.

## Testing Computer Software

Another classic book, but an essential one for understanding software testing and what it is all about. This book covers the basics of what every software developer should know about testing and test methodology.

## Introduction to Algorithms

Not an easy book by any means—requires some math—but it is one of the best books on the modern algorithms commonly used in software development today. Every software developer should be familiar with these algorithms.

## Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

This book covers just about everything you should know about writing large-scale, robust applications. Although the focus is on enterprise applications, many of the principles and patterns apply to any kind of large-scale software application.

## Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code

One essential skill in working with legacy code is refactoring. Refactoring is changing the structure of the code without changing its functionality. This book covers just about every major refactoring pattern you need to know. Now, most of these refactorings don’t have to be done manually any more, since they are baked into modern IDEs, but this book will teach you what they are and how to implement them when you have to.

## Working Effectively With Legacy Code

This is considered one of the best overall books for learning how to deal with and maintain legacy code. It covers just about every topic you can think of in dealing with legacy systems, including safely refactoring, identifying where to make code changes, dealing with systems that aren’t object-oriented, and much, much more.

## Refactoring to Patterns

One of the best ways to clean up legacy code through refactoring is to simplify it, especially if it is a mess. This book shows you exactly, step-by-step, how you can take existing code and refactor it using common design patterns found in software development. This doesn’t mean you should refactor every bit of code into design patterns, or forcefully implement overly-complex design patterns when a simpler solution will do, but there are definitely plenty of times where the content of this book will come in handy.

## The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

Based on the wisdom of a couple of very experienced software developers, this is an extremely popular programming book all about how to advance your career as a software developer.. It’s funny, it’s entertaining, it’s real stories about real difficult situations in software development.

## The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development

This book is chock-full of practical advice about your career as a software developer and the inevitable struggles you’ll face. It’s about learning how to increase your skills, changing your attitude, staying motivated, and keeping that passion alive, and of course, about advancing your career.
